* The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with machine level programming. 
A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases. 
Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin. 
If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. 
Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. 
The bomb is defused when every phase has been defused.
